Main Things:

  a) Video chat platform
      - should be able to have 5 to 10 people at a call simultaneously
      - User side: instructor's screen should be put on bigger display
      - Instructor side: the users window should be bigger on their screens

  b) Basic website (doesn't need to be aesthetically pleasing initially)
      
      - different pages to include:
        i. Home Page
        ii.
  c) Search Functionality
      - users should be able to search for specific classes
  d) Blogging Space (forum section)
      - kinda like reddit
      - no pics or videos allowed (would require moderators and all that)
      - just initial posting and comments that follow underneath that
  e) Login Page
      redirects to...
        - User Profiles
        - Instructor Profiles

  f) Scheduling for classes
      - whichever classes a person signs up for should be displayed on their user profile
      - should not allow clashing classes (classes that conflict with other classes timewise)

  g) Secure payment method
