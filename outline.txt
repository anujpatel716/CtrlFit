Main Things:

  a) Video chat platform
      - should be able to have 5 to 10 people at a call simultaneously
      - User side: instructor's screen should be put on bigger display
      - Instructor side: the users window should be bigger on their screens
          - should be able to click and full screen on one of the users
      - small chat box, agenda tab on the side (set up by instructor)

  b) Basic website (doesn't need to be aesthetically pleasing initially)

      - different pages to include:
        i. Home Page
        ii. About/How It Works
        iii. Live Classes (display schedule and timings of classes)
        iv. Instructors (display all instructors, if clicked on, go to their linked social media)
        v. Blog/Forum (kinda like leetcode discussion)
        vi. Login tab (should redirect to Login page)
        vii. Sign Up tab (should redirect to Creating an Account page)

  c) Search Functionality
      - included within Home Page and Live Classes page
      - users should be able to search for specific classes based on keywords (maybe instructors)

  d) Blogging Space (forum section)
      - kinda like leetcode discussion page
      - no pics or videos allowed (would require moderators and all that)
      - just initial posting and comments that follow underneath that
      - upvotes, downvotes, reporting, comments/replying to comments, rep number (?)
      - everything should be ranked according to views, upvotes, recent activity

  e) Login Page
      redirects to...
        - User Associated Page
            i. Live Classes Page should be different from Instructors (should be the same as the Basic Website Outline)
            ii. User Account Page
                - their likes/interests, classes they've signed up for, possible suggestions (classes)?, friends list (simple
                as adding friends, calendar display + invite)
        - Instructor Associated Page
            i. Live Classes Page is different from users
                - should include creating a class
            ii. Instructor Profile Page
                - bio/background, what they teach, links to social media, friends list (same as users ish), calendar display (shows
                what classes they are teaching and at what times)
        - Admin/Moderator
            i. has all the powa bby


  f) Scheduling for classes
      - whichever class a person signs up for should be displayed on their user profile
      - should not allow clashing classes (classes that conflict with other classes timewise)
      - within Live Class section, we should include filters (scroll down keywords i.e. HIIT, yoga, pilates, etc.) also their
        experience level and equipment (column section)

  g) Secure payment method
      - through paypal
